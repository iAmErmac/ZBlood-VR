  - Enables a lot of VR focused features such as positional melee attacks and item pulling
  
* [DamNums:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - DamNums is a pretty simple concept: shoot monsters and little numbers pop out that tell you how much damage you did
  
* [Top HP Bars:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - Really simple mod to add HP bars on top of enemies and players. Performance version is recommended for VR
  
* [PyWeaponWheel:](https://github.com/iAmErmac/PyWeaponWheel-VR)
  - An excellent and simple weapon wheel to quickly switch between weapons
  
* [Gearbox:](https://github.com/iAmErmac/gearbox)
